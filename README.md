Do you enjoy games developed by someone with zero artistic skill, no ability to plan things ahead, and nasty habit of losing interest in projects a few weeks into them? Then boy-howdy have I got the game for you! Ant Sim Your Pants!

After an afternoon of playing [World Box](https://www.superworldbox.com), I felt inspired to try to make a lifesim game of some sort. I've never done game development before, but thought I'd give [Phaser](https://phaser.io) a try as it seemed to be *the* Javascript game framework. A couple of hours later I'd made a little "game" with snakes and rats. There was no user input...so not much of a game. More just a simulation of randomly placed rats and snakes. Rats collide? Create another rat. Snakes collide with rats? Destroy the rat and feed the snake. Snake doesn't feed? Snake dies. Even wrote some simple code for the snakes to seek out the rats. 

But then I got bored. Snakes and rats? Yawn! Remember SimAnt? Now *that* was fun...so I decided to make that instead. Did I mention I have very little experience making games, pixel art, and sound effects? Do you like jank? Do you like a grown-ass man going "nom nom nom" into a laptop microphone to create his own sound effects? Then boy-howdy have I got the gam--- wait I already said that, didn't I? That's right, folks! This attention to detail is what you can expect from this little game!
